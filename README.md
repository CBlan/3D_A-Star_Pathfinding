__3d pathfinding solution using A* algorithim__

This Pathfinding solution was created for use with flying/floating units. I created this as unity's inbuilt navigation system deals only with navigation on 2D planes.

_Please feel free to expand on it, any improvments are appreciated._

__Features:__
- Full 3d pathfinding using A* search algorithim.
- Suitable for use in all environments.
- Suitable for use with multiple units.
- Responds to moving targets.
- Areas of lower pathing preference.
- Smoothed pathing.
- Weight blurring.
- Heap optimised and threaded.
